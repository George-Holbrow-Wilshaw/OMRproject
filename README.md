# OMRproject

This project uses Optical Music Recognition to learn attributes attached to musical notes. 

1) I use PyTorch to define a convolutional neural network and train it on data from Pascal Attwenger https://homepage.univie.ac.at/pascal.attwenger/bachelor/.

**Planned development**

1) Train an object detector to segment individual music notes
2) Train Faster R-CNN on the psuedo ground truths generated by a combination of the bounding boxes (stage 1) and the labels (which we know are sequential)
3) Test model on whole sheets of music rather than individual notes
